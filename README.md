Tumblr Tag Search
=================

I developed this project by myself for an Intro to Web Development class - it's pretty basic.  
It provides the most recent posts for any given tag on Tumblr in a clean format.

Running the project requires only a basic webserver - all files involved are static, and posts are requested on the client end.  
All that's required is to keep the `css/`, `img/`, and `js/` subdirectories intact and next to `index.html`, which can be named whatever you want.
